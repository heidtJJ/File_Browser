# File_Browser
A simple File Browser.

This software project is a file browser which allows people to open files as well as browse to other "links" within a file. 

Here are more details. The files are plain text files that may contain anchors
that provide links to other files. More precisely, an anchor is a string of the form:
    <a file text>
where file is the name of another file and text is a piece of text. 
For example, hereâ€™s a line of text that contains an anchor:
Here is more <a info.txt information.>

When an anchor is displayed, it should appear as:
    <text>[n]
where n is a number that is unique to this anchor. Anchors should be
numbered in order, starting at 1. For example, if the above line of text
contains the 5th anchor of the file, then it should be displayed as follows:
    Here is more <information.>[5]
